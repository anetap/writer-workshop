This document summarizes what the Red Hat Writers' Workshop attendees have learned about writing technical documentation.

== What does a technical writer do? [Michal]
. Describe the job of a technical writer. Use some markup, for example, highlight a word or two as http://asciidoc.org/asciidoc.css-embedded.html#X51[strong text].
. Think of a good title for this section.

== What is the documentation process? [Kamila]
. Describe what we mean by "documentation process". Provide a general introduction. Use some markup, for example, http://asciidoc.org/asciidoc.css-embedded.html#_bulleted_lists[bulleted lists].
. Think of a good title for this section.

=== Communication with SMEs [Max]
. Explain why it is necessary to communicate with SMEs. Explain what SME stands for. Use some markup, for example, highlight "subject matter expert" using http://asciidoc.org/asciidoc.css-embedded.html#X51[emphasized text].
. Think of a good title for this section.

=== Understanding the audience [David]
. Explain why it is necessary to optimize a technical text for the intended audience. Use some markup, for example, highlight a word or two as http://asciidoc.org/asciidoc.css-embedded.html#X51[strong text].
. Every text has its audience and so do _change logs_, _release notes_ and such. Writers therefore should follow the rules and recommendations for the text they're writing. For technical writers this is to write a text that does not contain metaphors, idioms and text figures that might not be clear for some people. *Technical text* therefore *should be simply written, descriptional and very exact*.
. Think of a good title for this section.

== What is technical English? [Markéta]
. Explain what technical English is. Use some markup, for example, highlight a word or two as http://asciidoc.org/asciidoc.css-embedded.html#X51[strong text].
. Think of a good title for this section.
. *Technical English* is English used in documentations where language has to be accurate and can't be misunderstood. Typically, you can't use _metaphors_, you should _avoid long hard-to-read sentences_ and also _relative clauses_ because they could be easily misread. 

=== Why is technical English used in technical documents? [Jakub]
. Explain the purpose of using technical English in technical docs. Use some markup, for example, highlight a word or two as http://asciidoc.org/asciidoc.css-embedded.html#X51[strong text].

==== Why is technical English used in technical documents

*Why?* That is almost the same question like 'Why is water in soup?' ;-) It is a must! Soup without water is not a soup. And the same work for technical English and technical document. Let's stop joking. Sorry.

*Technical English* is being used to avoid misinterpretations from readers. To be _clear_, _accurate_ and always _well understood_. Understanding technical documentation is necessary bacause instructions and descriptions are given about how technical software is used and managed. There is `no place for misunderstandings`.


=== What can happen when a technical text does not follow the rules of technical English? [Daniela]
. Describe what problems can the reader face if a technical writer fails to write in technical English. Use some markup, for example, highlight a word or two as http://asciidoc.org/asciidoc.css-embedded.html#X51[strong text].
. Think of a good title for this section.

=== Example [Běla]
. Add an example of non-technical and technical English. Use some markup, for example, http://asciidoc.org/asciidoc.css-embedded.html#X48[example blocks].
. Think of a good title for the section.
